# PySpace
PySpace is a python program that looks for duplicate files on your computer and deletes them to save space

Looking for duplicate files and then removing them manually proved annoying and boring to me, plus you might have 2 different files in 2 different directories with the same name, leading to confusion. So I wrote this program to automate the boring stuff, and because it relies on calculating md5 checksums for the files (something humans can't do) rather than just reading their names, it's less likely to make a mistake.

Hope you find it useful.
